# Extended-Isolation-Forest-vs.-Isolation-Forest
The Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) improves on the Isolation Forest by better handling multi-dimensional data and skewed distributions. While Isolation Forest isolates anomalies through random splits, EIF uses hyperplanes, enhancing its ability to detect complex anomalies and reduce bias in high-dimensional spaces.
